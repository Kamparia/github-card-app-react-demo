# GitHub Card App with ReactJS

## Introduction
This is a simple fun project for anyone that is looking to get started with ReactJS front-end development library. In this project, I've developed a quick and easy application that fetches a users profile from GitHub (using [GitHub Open API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)) and displays the information recieved.
